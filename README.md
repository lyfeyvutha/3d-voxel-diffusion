## 3D Shape Generation Through Voxel Diffusion ##

Train an AI to **mimic a procedural generator**.

Writing a script that programmatically generates a 3D dataset of one shape class (like the numeral '១'), complete with variations like rotations and scaling.

The goal is to train a generative model that learns the *underlying rules and style* of my script, so it can produce **new, novel 3D shapes** that look like they belong in that same family."
